Business Understanding

The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of the retail store’s sales data to uncover meaningful insights and trends.

Key objectives include:

Identifying sales spikes across months and quarters.

Performing quarterly profit and sales analysis to evaluate seasonal trends.

Analyzing profit margins across different regions to understand regional performance.

Highlighting the top customers contributing to the maximum revenue.

This analysis helps the business understand performance drivers, customer behavior, and areas for improvement in marketing and operations.

Data Understanding

The dataset used in this project contains transactional data from multiple retail stores, including:

Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date

Customer and Region Information

Product Category and Sub-Category

Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Discount

The data was chosen because it provides a holistic view of business operations across different dimensions—time, location, and customers.

Future enhancements could include integrating:

Customer demographics for segmentation analysis

Forecasting future sales using time-series modeling

Inventory turnover analysis
